    <p>
      <strong>Shrimp Prices</strong> is a data analysis project focused on studying and predicting shrimp price trends between 1991 and 2021.
      Using historical data, it applies <strong>Polynomial Regression</strong> to model the relationship between monthly changes and market prices.

      The project is built with <strong>Python</strong>, leveraging libraries such as
      <strong> NumPy</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>Scikit-learn</strong>, and
      <strong>Matplotlib</strong> for data processing, statistical modeling, and visualization.
      It demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world economic data to uncover
      patterns and forecast future price behavior.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This analysis explores shrimp price fluctuations using data collected between 1991 and 2021.
      The dataset includes monthly price changes, which were transformed and processed to train a
      <strong> polynomial regression model</strong> capable of capturing non-linear relationships
      between time and price variation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The workflow includes data cleaning, feature transformation, model training and evaluation,
      followed by visualization of both real and predicted values to assess performance.
      The model’s accuracy was evaluated using <strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</strong>.
